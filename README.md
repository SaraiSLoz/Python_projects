## PISA contest simulation:
The project involves designing a code to prepare 15-year-old students for the PISA test, focusing on the mathematics area. 
It will consist of two parts: practice exercises and a final exam. 
The code will start by requesting some personal information to recognize each student and save their data in a file
## Compilator project: 
I created a programming language similar to LOGO, which accepts instructions as programming syntax, 
such as: forward, back, left, right. These instructions allow moving the turtle through the canvas.
I designed the regular expressions, lexer, and syntax diagram for this new language. 
With this, I developed a compiler in Python that checks, according to the language rules, if input are correct and executed properly.
